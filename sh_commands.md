**echo**: takes one string argument and prints it to the shell window.
eg. echo 'Hello World'

#### List contents
  
  - **ls**: lists contents present in the current directory.
  eg. ls

  - **ls -l**: works same way as 'ls' but provides more details about files and directories.
  eg. ls -l

  - **ls -lh**: works same way as 'ls -l' while providing details in human readable format.
  eg. ls -lh

**pwd**: shows what the present working directory is.
eg. pwd

#### Moving and Creating files and directories

  - **mv**: moves file or directory from source to destination
  eg. mv file1.txt example_dir/file1.txt
  eg. mv file1.txt example_dir/
  
  Above two commands work the same way when moving files or directories in an already existing directory example_dir
